RShell is a replication of a terminal or command shell. 
It will prompt the user and read commands on a single line
being linked by connectors (&&, ||, ;). The commands that
RShell will execute are the common commands found 
in any general-use terminal (ex: cd, echo, ls,). 

#Bugs

Unable to get connectors to work properly besides semicolons.

Comments have not yet been integrated.

A call to exit will loop back to the prompt with odd output.
