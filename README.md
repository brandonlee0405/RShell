RShell is a replication of a terminal or command shell. 
It will prompt the user and read commands on a single line
being linked by connectors (&&, ||, ;). The commands that
RShell will execute are the common commands found 
in any general-use terminal (ex: cd, echo, ls,). 

#Bugs

Unable to get connectors to work properly besides semicolons.

Comments have not yet been integrated.

Outputs an error for the first command however, all single commands after that work well.
