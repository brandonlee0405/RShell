#Contents
RShell is a replication of a terminal or command shell. 
It will prompt the user and read commands on a single line
being linked by connectors (&&, ||, ;). The commands that
RShell will execute are the common commands found 
in any general-use terminal (ex: cd, echo, ls,). 
Further implementation allows the user to use the test
functionality as well as parentheses for hierarchical 
inputs into the terminal. The test command makes available input
flags such as -e, -d, and -f.
