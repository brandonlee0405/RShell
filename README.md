# RShell
RShell for CS100 by Neel Sethia and Bradon Lee.

RShell is a replication of a terminal or command shell. 
It will prompt the user and read commands on a single line
being linked by connectors (&&, ||, ;). The commands that
RShell will execute are the common commands found 
in any general-use terminal (ex: cd, echo, ls,).
